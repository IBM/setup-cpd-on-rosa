## Introduction

State the purpose of your tutorial, your intended audience, and the benefits readers can gain from it. Aim to grab the readerâ€™s interest quickly, using terms they are likely to search on and relate to.

## Prerequisites

- [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/) is required to complete this tutorial.
- Linux machine is required to run the terraform scripts
- [Terraform CLI](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) is required to run the terraform scripts.
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) is required to create instance on AWS.
- [Kubectl CLI](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) is required to run the terraform scripts.
- [ROSA CLI](https://cloud.redhat.com/products/amazon-openshift/download) is required to run the terraform scripts.

## Estimated time

CPD is a complex system that takes a few hours to setup, however using this tutorial, you will be able to setup Cloud Pak for Data in about 45 minutes.

## Steps

### Step 1: Create an OpenShift IAM user in AWS

An IAM user ***osdCcsAdmin*** within the AWS account has to be created for OpenShift installer to get access to your AWS infrastructure.

The IAM user needs at least **Programmatic access** access type enabled and this user must have the **AdministratorAccess** policy attached to it.

- Goto [Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home) on AWS console.
- Under **Access management** click on **Users**.

- Create a new user ***osdCcsAdmin*** by selecting AWS access types as follows:
  - Programmatic access
  - AWS Management Console access

- Create a user group to manage ***osdCcsAdmin*** permissions. Make sure to enable **AdministratorAccess** and create the group.

- Select the recently created user group to proceed.

- Optionally you can add Tags.

- Review the details and create a user.

- On Successfully creating ***osdCcsAdmin*** IAM User **Download csv** as you will require the **Access key ID** and the **Secret access key** in further steps.

- Also make a note of your Account ID as it will be required in further steps.
![aws account id](doc/source/images/awsaccountid.png)

- At this point, you will have successfully created: 
  - IAM user ***osdCcsAdmin*** with required permissions.
  - **AWS access ID**, **AWS account key ID** and **AWS secret access key** credentials.

### Step 2: Create a ROSA instance and deploy Cloud Pak for Data 4.0

#### Step 2.1: Enable ROSA instance and Download ROSA CLI

- Goto the [Red Hat OpenShift service on AWS](console.aws.amazon.com/rosa/home) on your AWS console and enable the Red Hat OpenShift service.

- You will get an option to download the [ROSA CLI](https://cloud.redhat.com/products/amazon-openshift/download). Download the CLI and move it to PATH.

- In terminal, run the follwoing command to setup AWS CLI.
  ```bash
  aws configure
  ```
  ```
  AWS Access Key ID [None]: <AWS Access Key ID>
  AWS Secret Access Key [None]: <AWS Secret Access Key>
  Default region name [None]: <AWS Region>
  Default output format [None]: json
  ```
- Once the AWS CLI is configured, run the following command verify ROSA CLI.
  ```bash
  rosa verify permissions
  ```
  ```
  I: Validating SCP policies...
  I: AWS SCP policies ok
  ```

#### Step 2.2: Create ROSA instance and Deploy Cloud Pak for Data

- Clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/IBM/cp4d-deployment/tree/master/managed-openshift/aws/terraform) in your local machine from where you will run the terraform commands.

- In the cloned repository, update the `##### AWS Configuration #####` section in the `variables.tf` file with the **AWS access ID**, **AWS account key ID** and **AWS secret access key** obtained from [Step 1](#step-1-create-an-openshift-iam-user-in-aws).

- Update the `region`, `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key` in the `variables.tf` file with the region and credentials of your AWS account.
  ```
  variable "region" {
    description = "The region to deploy the cluster in, e.g: us-west-2."
    default     = "YOUR_NEAREST_REGION"
  }

  variable "access_key_id" {
    type        = string
    description = "YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"

    validation {
      condition     = length(var.access_key_id) > 0
      error_message = "Access Key ID must be provided."
    }
  }

  variable "secret_access_key" {
    type        = string
    description = "YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"

    validation {
      condition     = length(var.secret_access_key) > 0
      error_message = "Secret Access Key must be provided."
    }
  }

  ```

- Also generate the [ROSA Token](https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/token/rosa) and update the `rosa_token` section in the `variables.tf` file with the token that you generated.

  ```
  variable "rosa_token" {
    type = string
    default = "YOUR_ROSA_TOKEN"
  }
  ```

- You can refer to the [VARIABLES.md](https://github.com/IBM/cp4d-deployment/blob/master/managed-openshift/aws/terraform/VARIABLES.md) for more details on the `variables.tf` file and environment configuration.

- The following components of the Cloud Pak for Data 4.0 can be deployed on OpenShift through the Terraform script:
  - Data Virtualization
  - Analytics Engine
  - Watson Knowledge Catalog
  - Watson Studio
  - Watson Machine Learning
  - Watson AI OpenScale
  - Cognos Dashboard Embedded
  - DataStage
  - Db2 Warehouse
  - Db2 Advanced Edition
  - Data Management Console
  - Cognos Analytics
  - SPSS Modeler

- For example, In this tutorial you will learn how to enable Watson Studio, Cognos Analytics, Watson Machine Learning and Watson Knowledge Catalog.

- Edit the `variable.tf` file and update the `watson_studio`, `cognos_analytics`, `watson_machine_learning` and `watson_knowledge_catalog` variables to `default = yes`.

  ```
  variable "watson_studio" {
      default = "yes"
  }

  variable "cognos_analytics" {
      default = "yes"
  }

  variable "watson_machine_learning" {
    default = "yes"
  }

  variable "watson_knowledge_catalog" {
    default = "yes"
  }

  ```
